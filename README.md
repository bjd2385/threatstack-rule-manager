### Rule Management with `tsctl`

`tsctl` allows you to perform the most common tasks in organization-level rule management, such as

* creating rules and rulesets,
* copying rules, both intra-organizational and extra, and
* 

In addition to the above, since the tool works out of a local directory (by default, 
`~/.threatstack`), it allows for version control with `git`.

### Environment Variables

* `API_KEY`:
* `API_ID`: 
* `LOGLEVEL`: (optional, default: `INFO`)
* `LAZY_EVAL`: (optional, default: `false`)
